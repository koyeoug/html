       <h2>HTML</h2>
       <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process,<br>
          without which a web page does not exist. Hypertext means that text has links,<br>
          termed hyperlinks,embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink,<br>
          it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations.<br>
          It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look.</p>
          <p>HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee.<br>
          The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3 recommendation.<br>
          This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.</p><br>
